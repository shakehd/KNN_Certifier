\section{Conclusion and Future work}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Developed a novel algorithm to certify the robustness of $k$-NN;
    \item Focus on completeness;
    \item Experimental evaluation showed overall good results;
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future Works}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Leverage high-order voronoi diagram to further reduce certification time;
    \item Adapt the algorithm to other distance metrics like the Manhattan distance or the more general
          Minkoswki distance.
  \end{itemize}

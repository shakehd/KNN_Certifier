\begin{frame}{Graph Construction Optimization}

  Consider only the samples within the hyperball centered in $x$ and radius
               \[
                     2\epsilon\sqrt{N} + d
               \]
  where \begin{itemize}
     \item $\epsilon$ is the radius of the $\ell_{\infty}$ ball;
     \item $d$ the distance between $x$ and its $k$-th closest sample;
     \item $N$ is the number of features;
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{alertblock}{Proposition}
     Given a perturbation region $P^{\epsilon}(x)$, the hyperball centered in $x$ with radius $2\epsilon\sqrt{N} + d$
     contains the $k$ closest samples of every point $x_0 \in P^{\epsilon}(x)$
